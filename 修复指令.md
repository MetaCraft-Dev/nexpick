Build failed! The error is: `page.tsx doesn't have a root layout`.
It seems we are missing the mandatory Root Layout file and Global CSS.

Please generate these two files for me:

1.  **`app/layout.tsx`**:
    - Import `Inter` font from `next/font/google`.
    - Import `./globals.css`.
    - Define metadata with title "NexPick Select".
    - Export the default `RootLayout` function containing `<html>` and `<body>`.

2.  **`app/globals.css`**:
    - Include standard Tailwind directives:
      ```css
      @tailwind base;
      @tailwind components;
      @tailwind utilities;
      ```

Please provide the code so I can apply it.
